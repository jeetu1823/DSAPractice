Given a string str, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that it can be found twice in the given string. The two identified subsequences A and B can use the same ith character from string str if and only if that ith character has different indices in A and B.

Example 1:

Input:
str = "axxxy"
Output: 2
Explanation:
The given array with indexes looks like
a x x x y 
0 1 2 3 4

The longest subsequence is "xx". 
It appears twice as explained below.

subsequence A
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence A
------
1 2  <-- index of str 


subsequence B
x x
0 1  <-- index of subsequence B
------
2 3  <-- index of str 

We are able to use character 'x' 
(at index 2 in str) in both subsequences
as it appears on index 1 in subsequence A 
and index 0 in subsequence B.



	int solve(string s,int x,int y){
	    
	    if(x==0 or y==0)return 0;
	    
	    if(s[x-1]==s[y-1] and x!=y){
	        
	        
	        //axxxy
	        //axxxy
	        
	        return 1+solve(s,x-1,y-1);
	    }
	    else{
	        
	        return max(solve(s,x,y-1),solve(s,x-1,y));
	    }
	}
	
	
		int LongestRepeatingSubsequence(string str){
		    // Code here
		    
		    return solve(str,str.size(),str.size());
		}
