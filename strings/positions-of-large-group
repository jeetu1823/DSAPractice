https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/
In a string s of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like s = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z", and "yy".

A group is identified by an interval [start, end], where start and end denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group.
In the above example, "xxxx" has the interval [3,6].

A group is considered large if it has 3 or more characters.

Return the intervals of every large group sorted in increasing order by start index.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.

public:
    vector<int>fun(string &s,int i,int j){
        
        while(s[i]==s[j]){
            j++;
        }
        
        return {i,j-1};
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string s) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size()-1;i++){
            
            vector<int>temp;
            
         temp= fun(s,i,i+1);
                
                if( (temp[1]-temp[0])+1>=3){
                    ans.push_back(temp);
                    i=temp[1];
                }
            }
   
      
        return ans;
    }
};
